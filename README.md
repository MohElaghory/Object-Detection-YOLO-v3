You only look once, or YOLO, is one of the faster object detection algorithms out there. Though it is no longer the most accurate object detection algorithm, it is a very good choice when you need real-time detection, without loss of too much accuracy.

YOLO v3 uses a variant of Darknet, which originally has 53 layer network trained on Imagenet. For the task of detection, 53 more layers are stacked onto it, giving us a 106 layer fully convolutional underlying architecture for YOLO v3. This is the reason behind the slowness of YOLO v3.

Here is what the architecture of YOLO looks like:
